# code 1 python

This project contains solutions in Python for 3 coding challenges dealing with time conversion, number analysis, and string manipulation.

## Files

- `code-1-python` - Contains implementation of the 3 solution functions 


## Challenge 1:

The `time_convert()` function handles converting a time in 12-hour format (with AM/PM) to its 24-hour equivalent time.

- Accepts the hour (1-12), minutes (0-59), and period ("AM" or "PM")
- Handles converting noon and midnight properly
- Returns string in HHMM 24-hour format




## Challenge 2: 

The `two_positives()` functions determines if there are exactly two positive integers out of three given.

- Accepts 3 integer arguments 
- Counts number of positives 
- Returns boolean True if count is 2, False otherwise

 


## Challenge 3: 
The `max_consonant()` function calculates maximum value of consecutive consonants in a string.

- Removes vowels, splits string into subsequences
- Sums letter values where a=1, b=2, ... z=26 per substring 
- Returns highest sum found




## Running the Code

To test the solutions, run `python3 challenge.py` after implementing solution functions in `solution.py`.
